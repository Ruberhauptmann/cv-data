  abstract = {The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state, which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a Sierpi\textbackslash 'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify these predictions in designer quantum materials.},

  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇=0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

Application to the transition-metal-dichalcogenide monolayer 1H−TaS2 reveals that coupling between the longitudinal-acoustic phonons and the electrons from an isolated low-energy metallic band is entirely responsible for phonon anomalies such as the mode softening and associated charge-density waves observed in this material. Our analysis allows us to distinguish between different mode-softening mechanisms including matrix-element effects, Fermi-surface nesting, and Van Hove scenarios. We find that matrix-element effects originating from a peculiar type of Dirac pseudospin textures control the charge-density-wave physics in 1H−TaS2 and similar transition metal dichalcogenides.},

However, these Fermi surfaces lead to a nonzero density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, which typically disfavors such superconducting states. It has thus not been clear whether they can be stable for reasonable pairing interactions or are in practice preempted by time-reversal-symmetric states with vanishing DOS. In this Letter, we show within BCS theory applied to a paradigmatic model that the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking states are indeed stabilized over broad parameter ranges at weak coupling. Moreover, we introduce a fast method that involves solving the inverse BCS gap equation, does not require iteration, does not suffer from convergence problems, and can handle metastable solutions.},

It has been argued that graphene doped to the van Hove singularity at 1/4 doping, where the density of states diverge, is particularly likely to be a chiral d-wave superconductor. In this review we summarize the currently mounting theoretical evidence for the existence of a chiral d-wave superconducting state in graphene, obtained with methods ranging from mean-field studies of effective Hamiltonians to angle-resolved renormalization group calculations. We further discuss the multiple distinctive properties of the chiral d-wave superconducting state in graphene, as well as its stability in the presence of disorder. We also review the means of enhancing the chiral d-wave state using proximity-induced superconductivity. The appearance of chiral d-wave superconductivity is intimately linked to the hexagonal crystal lattice and we also offer a brief overview of other materials which have also been proposed to be chiral d-wave superconductors.},

  abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

  abstract = {Understanding the nature of Cooper pairs is essential to describe the properties of superconductors. The original proposal of Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer (BCS) was based on electrons pairing with same energy and zero center-of-mass momentum. With the advent of new superconductors, different forms of pairing have been discussed. In particular, Cooper pairs with finite center-of-mass momentum have received large interest. Along with such finite-momentum pairs, pairing of electrons at different energies is also central to understanding some superconductors. Here, we investigate the interplay of finite-momentum and finite-energy Cooper pairs considering two different systems: a conventional s-wave superconductor under applied magnetic field and a d-wave finite-momentum pairing state in the absence of magnetic field relevant to correlated superconductors. Investigating both these systems, we find finite-energy pairs persisting independently of finite-momentum pairing, and that they lead to odd-frequency superconducting correlations. We contrast this finding by showing that the even-frequency correlations are predominantly driven by zero-energy pairs for most frequencies. We further calculate the Meissner effect and find that odd-frequency correlations are essential for correctly describing the Meissner effect.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental studies unveiled highly unconventional phenomena in the superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with ultraflat bands, which cannot be described by the conventional BCS theory. For example, given the small Fermi velocity of the flat bands, the superconducting coherence length predicted by BCS theory is more than 20 times shorter than the measured values. A new theory is needed to understand many of the unconventional properties of flat-band superconductors. In this Letter, we establish a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory from a microscopic flat-band Hamiltonian. The GL theory shows how the properties of the physical quantities such as the critical temperature, superconducting coherence length, upper critical field, and superfluid density are governed by the quantum metric of the Bloch states. One key conclusion is that the superconducting coherence length is not determined by the Fermi velocity but by the size of the optimally localized Wannier functions which are limited by the quantum metric. Applying the theory to TBG, we calculated the superconducting coherence length and the upper critical fields. The results match the experimental ones well without fine-tuning of parameters. The established GL theory provides a new and general theoretical framework for understanding flat-band superconductors with the quantum metric.},

We use the mean-field theory approach to obtain ground-state phase diagrams including the unconventional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, which is characterized by atypical behavior of the Cooper-pair total momentum. We show that the momentum changes its value as well as direction with a change of the system parameters. We discuss the influence of Van Hove singularities on the possibility of the reentrant FFLO phase occurrence, without a BCS precursor.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed.

  abstract = {A central result in superconductivity is that flat bands, though dispersionless, can still host a nonzero superfluid weight due to quantum geometry. We show that the derivation of the mean field superfluid weight in previous literature is incomplete, which can lead to severe quantitative and even qualitative errors. We derive the complete equations and demonstrate that the minimal quantum metric, the metric with minimum trace, is related to the superfluid weight in isolated flat bands. We complement this result with an exact calculation of the Cooper pair mass in attractive Hubbard models with the uniform pairing condition. When the orbitals are located at high-symmetry positions, the Cooper pair mass is exactly given by the quantum metric, which is guaranteed to be minimal. Moreover, we study the effect of closing the band gap between the flat and dispersive bands, and develop a mean field theory of pairing for different band-touching points via the S-matrix construction. In mean field theory, we show that a nonisolated flat band can actually be beneficial for superconductivity. This is a promising result in the search for high-temperature superconductivity as the material does not need to have flat bands that are isolated from other bands by the thermal energy. Our work resolves a fundamental caveat in understanding the relation of multiband superconductivity to quantum geometry, and the results on band touchings widen the class of systems advantageous for the search of high-temperature flat band superconductivity.},

  abstract = {We use the topological heavy fermion (THF) model and its Kondo lattice (KL) formulation to study the possibility of a symmetric Kondo (SK) state in twisted bilayer graphene. Via a large-N approximation, we find a SK state in the KL model at fillings ν=0,±1,±2 where a KL model can be constructed. In the SK state, all symmetries are preserved and the local moments are Kondo screened by the conduction electrons. At the mean-field level of the THF model at ν=0,±1,±2,±3 we also find a similar symmetric state that is adiabatically connected to the symmetric Kondo state. We study the stability of the symmetric state by comparing its energy with the ordered (symmetry-breaking) states found in [H. Hu et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 026502 (2023)., Z.-D. Song and B. A. Bernevig, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 047601 (2022).] and find the ordered states to have lower energy at ν=0,±1,±2. However, moving away from integer fillings by doping the light bands, our mean-field calculations find the energy difference between the ordered state and the symmetric state to be reduced, which suggests the loss of ordering and a tendency toward Kondo screening. In order to include many-body effects beyond the mean-field approximation, we also performed dynamical mean-field theory calculations on the THF model in the nonordered phase. The spin susceptibility follows a Curie behavior at ν=0,±1,±2 down to ∼2 K where the onset of screening of the local moment becomes visible. This hints to very low Kondo temperatures at these fillings, in agreement with the outcome of our mean-field calculations. At noninteger filling ν=±0.5,±0.8,±1.2 dynamical mean-field theory shows deviations from a 1/T susceptibility at much higher temperatures, suggesting a more effective screening of local moments with doping. Finally, we study the effect of a C3z-rotational-symmetry-breaking strain via mean-field approaches and find that a symmetric phase (that only breaks C3z symmetry) can be stabilized at sufficiently large strain at ν=0,±1,±2. Our results suggest that a symmetric Kondo phase is strongly suppressed at integer fillings, but could be stabilized either at noninteger fillings or by applying strain.},

With a customized algorithm and compiler tuning we are able to achieve a 19×speedup compared to the CPU (119×compared to a single CPU core), reducing calculation time from minutes to mere seconds, enabling the analysis of larger systems and the elimination of finite size effects.

  abstract = {Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is a recently discovered two-dimensional superlattice structure which exhibits strongly-correlated quantum many-body physics, including strange metallic behavior and unconventional superconductivity. Most of TBG exotic properties are connected to the emergence of a pair of isolated and topological flat electronic bands at the so-called magic angle, \$\textbackslash theta \textbackslash approx 1.05\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$, which are nevertheless very fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an interval of approximately \$0.8\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}{$<\backslash$}theta{$<$}1.3\textasciicircum\{\textbackslash circ\}\$. As highlighted by a simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB), induced by the chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. Additionally, TRSB suppresses the Berry curvature and induces a topological phase transition, with a gap closing at the \$\textbackslash Gamma\$ point, towards a band structure with two isolated flat bands with Chern number equal to \$0\$. The efficiency of the cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter coupling and the optical cavity characteristic frequency. Our results demonstrate the possibility of engineering flat bands in TBG using optical devices, extending the onset of strongly-correlated topological electronic phases in moir\textbackslash 'e superlattices to a wider range in the twisting angle.},

Here we propose an experimental setup to create anyons in one-dimensional lattices with fully tuneable exchange statistics. In our setup, anyons are created by bosons with occupation-dependent hopping amplitudes, which can be realized by assisted Raman tunnelling. The statistical angle can thus be controlled in situ by modifying the relative phase of external driving fields. This opens the fascinating possibility of smoothly transmuting bosons via anyons into fermions and of inducing a phase transition by the mere control of the particle statistics as a free parameter. In particular, we demonstrate how to induce a quantum phase transition from a superfluid into an exotic Mott-like state where the particle distribution exhibits plateaus at fractional densities.},

The comprehensive presentation of the theoretical basis for the FFLO state that we provide is useful also for research on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in other physical systems. We focus on settings that have been predicted to be favourable for the FFLO state, such as optical lattices in various dimensions and spin–orbit coupled systems. These are also the most likely systems for near-future experimental observation of the FFLO state. Theoretical bounds, such as Bloch’s and Luttinger’s theorems, and experimentally important limitations, such as finite-size effects and trapping potentials, are considered. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of the various ideas presented for the observation of the FFLO state. We conclude our review with an analysis of the open questions related to the FFLO state, such as its stability, superfluid density, collective modes and extending the FFLO superfluid concept to new types of lattice systems.},

The symmetry and spatial dimension determines a general universality class, which corresponds to one of the 2 types of complex and 8 types of real Clifford algebras. The phases within a given class are further characterized by a topological invariant, an element of some Abelian group that can be 0, Z, or Z\_2. The interface between two infinite phases with different topological numbers must carry some gapless mode. Topological properties of finite systems are described in terms of K-homology. This classification is robust with respect to disorder, provided electron states near the Fermi energy are absent or localized. In some cases (e.g., integer quantum Hall systems) the K-theoretic classification is stable to interactions, but a counterexample is also given.},

  abstract = {The advent of high-𝑇𝑐 superconductors gave great impetus to the development of thin-film superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) for operation at temperatures up to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, 77 K. The spectral density of the white flux noise can be calculated analytically for rf SQUIDs and by computer simulation for dc SQUIDs; however, observed noise spectral densities are typically an order of magnitude higher. Low-frequency 1/𝑓 noise from thermally activated vortex motion is a much bigger issue in high-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs at 77 K than in low-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs because of the low flux-pinning energies in high-𝑇𝑐 superconductors. The magnitude of the noise depends strongly on the quality of the thin films, and much effort has been expended to improve techniques for depositing YBa2⁢Cu3⁢O7−𝑥 (YBCO) on lattice-matched single-crystal substrates. Substantial effort has also been invested in the development of new types of Josephson junctions, of which grain-boundary junctions are the most widely used in SQUIDs. Appropriate electronic read-out schemes largely eliminate 1/𝑓 noise from fluctuations in the junction critical current in both rf and dc SQUIDs. Typical levels of white flux noise are a few 𝜇⁢𝛷0⁢Hz−1/2 (𝛷0 is the flux quantum). Magnetometers—consisting of a superconducting flux transformer coupled to a SQUID—achieve a white magnetic-field noise as low as 10 fT Hz−1/2, increasing to typically 30 fT Hz−1/2 at 1 Hz. When these devices are operated in an unshielded environment, it is important to minimize the motion of trapped vortices and induced supercurrents, which can greatly increase the 1/𝑓 noise. The ambient noise is far greater than the intrinsic noise of the devices, but can be substantially reduced by various gradiometer configurations. There is now considerable effort to apply high-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs in magnetocardiology, nondestructive evaluation, microscopy, and geophysics.},

We explore the dynamical behavior of two anyons undergoing quantum walks, and observe the anyonic Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect, as well as the formation of bound states without on-site interactions. Once interactions are introduced, we observe spatially asymmetric transport in contrast to the symmetric dynamics of bosons and fermions.

In the present paper a theory is constructed which is free from these faults. We find equations for the ψ-function of the “superconducting electrons” which we introduced and for the vector potential. We have solved these equations for the one-dimensional case (a superconducting half-space and flat plates). The theory makes it possible to express the surface tension in terms of the critical magnetic field and the penetration depth of the magnetic field in superconductors. The penetration depth depends in a strong field on the field strength and this effect will be especially evident in the case of small size superconductors. The destruction of superconductivity in thin plates by a magnetic field is through a second-order phase transition and it only becomes a first-order transition starting with plates of a thickness more than a certain critical thickness. While the critical external magnetic field increases with decreasing thickness of the plates, the critical current for destroying the superconductivity of plates decreases with decreasing thickness.},

The two possibilities, corresponding to symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions, appear in a natural way in the formalism.

Contrary to conventional S/N/S JJs in which the critical Josephson current vanishes when the Fermi velocity goes to zero, we show here that the critical current in the S/FB/S junction is controlled by the quantum metric length \$\textbackslash xi\_\{QM\}\$ of the flat bands. Microscopically, when \$\textbackslash xi\_\{QM\}\$ of the flat band is long enough, the interface bound states originally localized at the two S/FB, FB/S interfaces can penetrate deeply into the flat band material and hybridize to form Andreev bound states (ABS). These ABS are able to carry long range and sizable supercurrents. Importantly, \$\textbackslash xi\_\{QM\}\$ also controls how far the proximity effect can penetrate into the flat band material. This is in sharp contrast with de Gennes' theory for S/N junctions in which the proximity effect is expected to be zero when the Fermi velocity of the normal metal is zero. We further suggest that the S/FB/S junctions gives rise to a new type of resonant Josephson transistors which can carry sizeable and highly gate-tunable supercurrent.},

Next, we apply the tight-binding model to graphene and compare such description with the brick lattice, showing that graphene lattice can be mapped as a square lattice with some hopping parameters being neglected.

This curious phenomenon seems to contradict all our customary conceptions in physics. Particularly striking was the experiment of Kamerlingh Onnes and Tuyn, in which a current was induced in a supraconducting ring of lead and was found to persist there without any measurable decrease for many hours—so long as the low temperature could be maintained. This experiment seems to present a unique case of motion without any friction, whilst we have been accustomed to see in every mechanism an occasion for dissipation of kinetic energy into heat.},

  abstract = {In narrow-band systems electrons can interact with each other via a short-range nonretarded attractive potential. The origin of such an effective local attraction can be polaronic or it can be due to a coupling between electrons and excitons or plasmons. It can also result from purely chemical (electronic) mechanisms, especially in compounds with elements favoring disproportionation of valent states. These mechanisms are discussed and an exhaustive list of materials in which such local electron pairing occurs is given. The authors review the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of such systems in several limiting scenarios: (i) Systems with on-site pairing which can be described by the extended negative-𝑈 Hubbard model. The strong-attraction limit of this model, at which it reduces to a system of tightly bound electron pairs (bipolarons) on a lattice, is extensively discussed. These electron pairs behaving as hard-core charged bosons can exhibit a superconducting state analogous to that of superfluid 4He II. The change-over from weak-attraction BCS-like superconductivity to the superfluidity of charged hard-core bosons is examined. (ii) Systems with intersite pairing described by an extended Hubbard model with 𝑈{$>$}0 and nearest-neighbor attraction and/or nearest-neighbor spin exchange as well as correlated hopping. (iii) A mixture of local pairs and itinerant electrons interacting via a charge-exchange mechanism giving rise to a mutually induced superconductivity in both subsystems. The authors discuss to what extent the picture of local pairing, and in particular superfluidity of hard-core charged bosons on a lattice, can be an explanation for the superconducting and normal-state properties of the high-𝑇𝑐 oxides: doped BaBiO3 and the cuprates.},

  abstract = {The qualitative reliability of the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is investigated for systems in which either the actual carrier density or the effective carrier density is low, by comparing the exact perturbative and dynamical mean-field expressions of electron-scattering rates and optical conductivities. We study two interacting systems: tight-binding models in which the chemical potential is near a band edge and Dirac systems in which the chemical potential is near the Dirac point. In both systems it is found that DMFT underestimates the low frequency, near-Fermi-surface single-particle scattering rate by a factor proportional to the particle density. The quasiparticle effective mass is qualitatively incorrect for the low density tight-binding model but not necessarily for Dirac systems. The dissipative part of the optical conductivity is more subtle: in the exact calculation vertex corrections, typically neglected in DMFT calculations, suppress the low frequency optical absorption, compensating for some of the DMFT underestimate of the scattering rate. The role of vertex corrections in calculating the conductivity for Dirac systems is clarified and a systematic discussion is given of the approach to the Galilean- or Lorentz-invariant low-density limit. Relevance to recent calculations related to Weyl metals is discussed.},

The model is solved in the dynamical mean-field approximation using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver. We determine the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the SC order parameter and show that the phonon-induced retardation or the strong Coulomb interaction leads to a significant reduction and shift of the Tc dome if one interprets the system as having an effective static interaction Ueff given by the Hubbard U reduced by the phonon-mediated attraction in the static limit. This behavior is analyzed by comparison to an effective static model in the polaron representation with a reduced bandwidth. We also determine the finite-temperature phase diagram including AF and CO. In the moderate-coupling regime, there is a hysteretic region of AF and CO around Ueff = 0, while the two phases are separated by a paramagnetic metal in the weak-coupling regime and a paramagnetic insulator in the strong coupling regime.},

  abstract = {Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the band as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are calculated within cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find that while the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are good indicators of superconductivity near zero temperature, at finite temperatures the behavior is more complicated. Our results suggest that the properties of the other bands near the flat band(s) are crucial.},

  abstract = {Topological invariants built from the periodic Bloch functions characterize new phases of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superconductors. The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the quantum Hall effect. Here we provide a general result for the superfluid weight Ds of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number C. We find that the integral over the Brillouin-zone of the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound Ds⩾|C|. Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero. As an example, we provide Ds for the time-reversal invariant attractive Harper–Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.},

In this work, we introduce a real-space topological invariant capable of identifying time-quasiperiodic Majoranas by leveraging the system's spectral localizer, which integrates information from both Hamiltonian and position operators. Drawing insights from non-Hermitian physics, we establish criteria for constructing the localizer and elucidate the robustness of this invariant in the presence of dense spectra. Our numerical simulations, focusing on a Kitaev chain driven by two incommensurate frequencies, validate the efficacy of our approach.},

However, the related experiments are mostly limited to engineered materials, such as moiré systems1–3. Here we present a catalogue of the naturally occuring three-dimensional stoichiometric materials with flat bands around the Fermi level. We consider 55,206 materials from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database catalogued using the Topological Quantum Chemistry website4,5, which provides their structural parameters, space group, band structure, density of states and topological characterization. We combine several direct signatures and properties of band flatness with a high-throughput analysis of all crystal structures. In particular, we identify materials hosting line-graph or bipartite sublattices—in either two or three dimensions—that probably lead to flat bands. From this trove of information, we create the Materials Flatband Database website, a powerful search engine for future theoretical and experimental studies. We use the database to extract a curated list of 2,379 high-quality flat-band materials, from which we identify 345 promising candidates that potentially host flat bands with charge centres that are not strongly localized on the atomic sites. We showcase five representative materials and provide a theoretical explanation for the origin of their flat bands close to the Fermi energy using the S-matrix method introduced in a parallel work6.},

  abstract = {The recent realization of twisted, two-dimensional, bilayers exhibiting strongly correlated states has created a platform in which the relation between the properties of the electronic bands and the nature of the correlated states can be studied in unprecedented ways. The reason is that these systems allow extraordinary control of the electronic bands’ properties, for example by varying the relative twist angle between the layers forming the system. In particular, in twisted bilayers the low energy bands can be tuned to be very flat and with a nontrivial quantum metric. This allows the quantitative and experimental exploration of the relation between the metric of Bloch quantum states and the properties of correlated states. In this work we first review the general connection between quantum metric and the properties of correlated states that break a continuous symmetry. We then discuss the specific case when the correlated state is a superfluid and show how the quantum metric is related to its superfluid stiffness. To exemplify such relation we show results for the case of superconductivity in magic angle twisted bilayer graphene. We conclude by discussing possible research directions to further elucidate the connection between quantum metric and correlated states’ properties.},

  abstract = {Universal scaling laws can guide the understanding of new phenomena, and for cuprate high-temperature superconductivity the influential Uemura relation showed, early on, that the maximum critical temperature of superconductivity correlates with the density of the superfluid measured at low temperatures. Here we show that the charge content of the bonding orbitals of copper and oxygen in the ubiquitous CuO2 plane, measured with nuclear magnetic resonance, reproduces this scaling. The charge transfer of the nominal copper hole to planar oxygen sets the maximum critical temperature. A three-dimensional phase diagram in terms of the charge content at copper as well as oxygen is introduced, which has the different cuprate families sorted with respect to their maximum critical temperature. We suggest that the critical temperature could be raised substantially if one were able to synthesize materials that lead to an increased planar oxygen hole content at the expense of that of planar copper.},

  abstract = {It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a Z or a Z\_2 topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via dimensional reduction by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in Kaluza-Klein-like fashion). For Z-topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The Z\_2-topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent Z-topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The 8-fold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle-hole symmetries) is a reflection of the 8-fold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). We derive a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators/superconductors with chiral symmetry and the Chern-Simons invariant: it relates the invariant to the electric polarization (d=1), or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3). Finally, we discuss topological field theories describing the space time theory of linear responses, and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification.},

Since these states are energetically highly unfavorable they are susceptible to effects that shift them to finite energy. We investigate the free energy of two different mechanisms: spontaneous phase gradients in the superconducting order parameter and surface ferromagnetism caused by Fermi liquid interaction effects. We find that the surface magnetization appears at lower temperatures than the spontaneous current flow of the phase-crystal state. The magnetic state can, however, be energetically favorable at lower temperatures for sufficiently strong Fermi liquid effects. As a result, first-order transitions between the two states are possible, suggesting a rich low-temperature phase diagram in \$d\$-wave superconductors.},

Furthermore, the parallelization parameters offered by Quantum ESPRESSO let calculations scale beyond a single node when used right.

Here we asses the potential of monolayer semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) for Coulomb engineering in a material realistic and quantitative manner. We compare the response of different TMDC materials to modifications of their dielectric surrounding, analyze effects of dynamic substrate screening, i.e., frequency dependencies in the dielectric functions, and discuss inherent length scales of Coulomb-engineered heterojunctions. We find symmetric and rigid-shift-like quasiparticle band-gap modulations for both instantaneous and dynamic substrate screening. From this, we derive short-ranged self-energies for an effective multiscale modeling of Coulomb-engineered heterojunctions composed of a homogeneous monolayer placed on a spatially structured substrate. For these heterojunctions, we show that band-gap modulations on the length scale of a few lattice constants are possible, rendering external limitations of the substrate structuring more important than internal effects. We find that all semiconducting TMDCs are similarly well suited for these external and noninvasive modifications.},

These recent key developments are merging into a flourishing research topic: understanding the possible connection and ramifications of quantum geometry on the induced superconductivity and superfluidity in moiré multilayer and other flat-band systems. This article presents an introduction to how quantum geometry governs superconductivity and superfluidity in platforms including, and beyond, graphene. Ultracold gases are introduced as a complementary platform for quantum geometric effects and a comparison is made to moiré materials. An outlook sketches the prospects of twisted multilayer systems in providing the route to room-temperature superconductivity.},

Non-linear coupling of transverse and longitudinal phonons is essential for the formation of the CDW and the full gap above the Fermi level.

  abstract = {The many-body theory of interacting electrons poses an intrinsically difficult problem that requires simplifying assumptions. For the determination of electronic screening properties of the Coulomb interaction, the random phase approximation (RPA) provides such a simplification. Here we explicitly show that this approximation is justified for band structures with sizable band gaps. This is when the electronic states responsible for the screening are energetically far away from the Fermi level, which is equivalent to a short electronic propagation length of these states. The RPA contains exactly those diagrams in which the classical Coulomb interaction covers all distances, whereas neglected vertex corrections involve quantum tunneling through the barrier formed by the band gap. Our analysis of electron-electron interactions provides a real-space analogy to Migdal's theorem on the smallness of vertex corrections in electron-phonon problems. An important application is the increasing use of constrained RPA calculations of effective interactions. We find that their usage of Kohn-Sham energies accounts for the leading local (excitonic) vertex correction in insulators.},

We leverage two concepts: firstly, the intermediate representation (IR), an optimal compression of the propagator with robust a priori error estimates, and secondly, sparse sampling, near-optimal grids in imaginary time and imaginary frequency from which the propagator can be reconstructed and on which diagrammatic equations can be solved. IR and sparse sampling are packaged into stand-alone, easy-to-use Python, Julia and Fortran libraries, which can readily be included into existing software. We also include an extensive set of sample codes showcasing the library for typical many-body and ab initio methods.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity was recently reported in several quasicrystalline systems. These are materials which are structurally ordered, but since they are not translationally invariant, the usual BCS theory does not apply. At the present time, the underlying mechanism and the properties of the superconducting phase are insufficiently understood. To gain a better understanding of quasiperiodic superconductors, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci chain, and examine its low-temperature superconducting phase in detail using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We obtain superconducting solutions as a function of the parameters controlling the physical properties of the system: the strength of the Hubbard attraction \$U\$, the chemical potential \$\textbackslash mu\$, and the strength of the modulation of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, \$w\$. We find that there is a bulk transition at a critical temperature that obeys a power law in \$U\$. The local superconducting order parameter is self-similar both in real and perpendicular space. The local densities of states vary from site to site, however, the width of the superconducting gap is the same on all sites. The interplay between the Hubbard attraction and the intrinsic gaps of the Fibonacci chain results in a complex zero-temperature \$\textbackslash mu\$-\$U\$ phase diagram with insulating domes surrounded by superconducting regions. Finally, we show that tuning \$w\$ from weak to strong quasicrystalline modulation gives rise to qualitatively different thermodynamic behaviors as could be observed by measuring the specific heat.},

  abstract = {A wide range of materials, like d-wave superconductors, graphene, and topological insulators, share a fundamental similarity: their low-energy fermionic excitations behave as massless Dirac particles rather than fermions obeying the usual Schrödinger Hamiltonian. This emergent behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems defines the unifying framework for a class of materials we call “Dirac materials.” In order to establish this class of materials, we illustrate how Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac fermions have been identified experimentally using electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials shares a significant number of universal properties in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these common properties including nodal points in the excitation spectrum, density of states, specific heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as discuss many-body interaction effects. We further review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is controlled by specific symmetries of the material, such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin–orbit symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their distinct real material background leads to rich novel physics with common fingerprints such as the suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced resonant states.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A\$\_3\$C\$\_\{60\}\$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length (\$\textbackslash xi\_0\$) and the London penetration depth (\$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{L\}\}\$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.},

Since the computational effort of diagrammatic many-body techniques increases with the number of required Matsubara frequencies and thus with the inverse temperature, phase transitions that occur at low temperatures are typically hard to address numerically. In this work, we implement a fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approach to spin fluctuations and superconductivity using the “intermediate representation basis” (IR) [Shinaoka et al., Phys. Rev. B 96, 035147 (2017)] for Matsubara Green functions. This FLEX+IR approach is numerically very efficient and enables us to reach temperatures on the order of 10−4 in units of the electronic bandwidth in multiorbital systems. After benchmarking the method in the doped repulsive Hubbard model on the square lattice, we study the possibility of spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in the hydrated sodium cobalt material NaxCoO2⋅yH2O reaching the scale of the experimental transition temperature Tc=4.5K and below.},

  abstract = {The superfluid properties of attractive Hubbard model in dice lattice are investigated. It is found that three superfluid order parameters increase as the interaction increases. When the filling factor falls into the flat band, due to the infinite large density of states, the resultant superfluid order parameters are proportional to interaction strength, which is in striking contrast with the exponentially small counterparts in usual superfluid (or superconductor). When the interaction is weak, and the filling factor is near the bottom of the lowest band (or the top of highest band), the superfluid density is determined by the effective mass of the lowest (or highest) single-particle band. When the interaction is strong and filling factor is small, the superfluid density is inversely proportional to interaction strength, which is related to effective mass of tightly bound pairs. In the strong interaction limit and finite filling, the asymptotic behaviors of superfluid density can be captured by a parabolic function of filling factor. Furthermore, when the filling is in flat band, the superfluid density shows a logarithmic singularity as the interaction approaches zero. In addition, there exist three undamped collective modes for strong interactions. The lowest excitation is gapless phonon, which is characterized by the total density oscillations. The two others are gapped Leggett modes, which correspond relative density fluctuations between sublattices. The collective modes are also reflected in the two-particle spectral functions by sharp peaks. Furthermore, it is found that the two-particle spectral functions satisfy an exact sum-rule, which is directly related to the filling factor (or density of particle). The sum-rule of the spectral functions may be useful to distinguish between the hole-doped and particle-doped superfluid (superconductor) in experiments.},

We show that the predicted nontrivial topology of the two lowest flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) plays an important role in the enhancement of the superfluid weight and hence of superconductivity. We derive the superfluid weight (phase stiffness) of the TBLG superconducting flat bands with a uniform pairing, and show that it can be expressed as an integral of the Fubini-Study metric of the flat bands. This mirrors results already obtained for nonzero Chern number bands even though the TBLG flat bands have zero Chern number. We further show that the metric integral is lower bounded by the topological C2zT Wilson loop winding number of TBLG flat bands, which renders that the superfluid weight is also bounded by this topological index. In contrast, trivial flat bands have a zero superfluid weight. The superfluid weight is crucial in determining the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the superconductor. Based on the transition temperature measured in TBLG experiments, we estimate the topological contribution of the superfluid weight in TBLG.},

  abstract = {In this article we review essential natures of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) from a universal point of view. First we summarize experimental results on SCES by focusing on typical materials such as cuprates, BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and ruthenate Sr2RuO4. Experimental results on other important SCES, heavy-fermion systems, will be reviewed separately. The formalism to discuss superconducting properties of SCES is shown based on the Dyson–Gor'kov equations. Here two typical methods to evaluate the vertex function are introduced: One is the perturbation calculation up to the third-order terms with respect to electron correlation. Another is the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) method based on the Baym–Kadanoff conserving approximation. The results obtained by the FLEX method are in good agreement with those obtained by the perturbation calculation. In fact, a reasonable value of Tc for spin-singlet d-wave superconductivity is successfully reproduced by using both methods for SCES such as cuprates and BEDT-TTF organic superconductors. As for Sr2RuO4 exhibiting spin-triplet superconductivity, it is quite difficult to describe the superconducting transition by using the FLEX calculation. However, the superconductivity can be naturally explained by the perturbation calculation, since the third-order terms in the anomalous self-energy play the essential role to realize the triplet superconductivity. Another important purpose of this article is to review anomalous electronic properties of SCES near the Mott transition, since the nature of the normal state in SCES has been one of main issues to be discussed. Especially, we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed in under-doped cuprates and organic superconductors. A variety of scenarios to explain the pseudogap phenomena based on the superconducting and/or spin fluctuations are critically reviewed and examined in comparison with experimental results. According to the recent theory, superconducting fluctuations, inherent in the quasi-two-dimensional and strong-coupling superconductors, are the origin of the pseudogap formation. In these compounds, superconducting fluctuations induce a kind of resonance between the Fermi-liquid quasi-particle and the Cooper-pairing states. This resonance gives rise to a large damping effect of quasi-particles and reduces the spectral weight near the Fermi energy. We discuss the magnetic and transport properties as well as the single-particle spectra in the pseudogap state by the microscopic theory of the superconducting fluctuations. As for heavy-fermion superconductors, experimental results are reviewed and several theoretical analyses on the mechanism are provided based on the same viewpoint as explained above.},
