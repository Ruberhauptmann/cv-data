  abstract = {This thesis examines Quantum ESPRESSO, a suite of computer code for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling in terms of its scalability on multiple processors on the PHYSnet compute cluster. A series of benchmarks is carried out to test different combination of compilers as well as parallelization parameters offered by Quantum ESPRESSO itself. These benchmarks show that using a set of compilers and auxiliary code in Intel oneAPI significantly improves scaling, with up to three times faster calculations on a single compute node. Furthermore, the parallelization parameters offered by Quantum ESPRESSO let calculations scale beyond a single node when used right. Results from these benchmarks were then used to carry out efficient phonon calculations on TaS2 in a charge-density-wave phase, the results of which could explain a gap feature near the Fermi level observed in a 2019 STS experiment on this material [1].},
